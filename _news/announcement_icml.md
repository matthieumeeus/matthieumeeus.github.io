Presented three papers at ICML '25! One at the main conference on [privacy auditing of synthetic text](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14921) and two papers at the [memorization workshop](https://icml2025memfm.github.io/), both ([1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.15523),[2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20481)) touching upon how near-duplicates (and beyond) contribute to LLM memorization.
