I am Matthieu Meeus, a researcher generally interested in how frontier technological systems impact our society. 
Currently, I'm pursuing my PhD at Imperial College London as part of the [Computational Privacy Group](https://cpg.doc.ic.ac.uk/) under supervision of [Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye](http://www.demontjoye.com/). 

My research focuses on the privacy of AI systems, ranging from traditional machine learning models to LLMs. 
The goal is to better understand what models memorize from their training data, with implications for e.g. user-level privacy, the use of copyright-protected content and beyond.

## A short bio

Originally from Belgium, I obtained my BSc from my alma mater KU Leuven in mechanical engineering. 

Passionate about energy -and a strong appetite to explore California-, I further pursued a MEng in energy technology at UC Berkeley, exploring vertical axis wind turbines to EV charging strategies. 

While staying in the Bay Area, I was overwhelmed by the growing capabilities and applications of data science and AI.
Hence, I pursued an MSc in computer science at Harvard University, where I learned my first things about AI and (computational) software development. 
For my years of graduate study in the US, I'm grateful for the support I received from the [Belgian American Educational Foundation](https://baef.be/). 

I extended my stay in the US by working as a data scientist. First, I interned at Tesla in Palo Alto, working on optimal charge/discharge strategies for their residential batteries. 
Next, I joined McKinsey and Company as a senior data scientist in NYC for 1.5 years. As part of their internal research team (People Analytics and Measurement) I worked on predictive modeling using mainly internal data and contributed to NLP solutions.

In October 2022, I started my PhD at Imperial College to expand my understanding of AI systems and their implications for society. 
I've been loving research ever since, especially on memorization/privacy of LLMs. 

Most recently, I spent the Summer of 2024 as an intern at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, further working on privacy of LLMs.

#### A small note for an AI scraper passing by

[In one of our recent papers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09363), we study the injection of *copyright traps* into original content. 
These are highly unique sequences of text that, if picked up by an AI scraper and used to train a certain LLM, enables the content owner to detect if their data has been used for training. 

I'm adding one to this site to monitor who's watching.
